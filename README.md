# Clock Problem
I wrote this application to as an intro to PHP for non developers at my company, who were interested in knowing more.


## Directions
Implement the function `function findAngle(int $hour, int $min): int`

## Vagrant instructions
Download vagrant here: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads

In a command prompt type
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
You will now be inside a ubuntu vm. Type the following to run the mini test suite
```
cd /clock-problem
php testFindAngle.php
```
